# WALMART STORE SALES PREDICTION - FORECASTING


 Walmart stores located in different
regions. Each store contains a number of departments, and you are tasked with predicting
the department-wide sales for each store.
In addition, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year.
These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super
Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are
weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge
presented by this competition is modelling the effects of markdowns on these holiday
weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data.
